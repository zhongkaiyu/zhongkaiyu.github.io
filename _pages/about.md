I am currently a first year PhD student in the CSE department of UC San Diego, working with Prof.[Yufei Ding](https://picassolab.squarespace.com/yufei). Before coming to UCSD, I obtained my master's degree from Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences under supervision of Prof. [Yunji Chen](https://novel.ict.ac.cn/ychen/). Prior to that, I received my bachelor's degree from Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

My research interests primarily lie in Computer Architecture, AI Accelerators, and Machine Leanrning Systems.
